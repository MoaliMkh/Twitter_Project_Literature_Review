## People's Personalities and Feelings in Social Network

- [Personality Traits Recognition on Social Network - Facebook](https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/ICWSM/article/view/14464)
  + Explanation: This paper presents automatic recognition of Big-5 personality traits on social network (Facebook) using users’ status text.
- [An Introduction to Social Network Analysis for Personality and Social Psychologists](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1948550617709114)
  + Explanation: This paper discusses Social network analysis (SNA). SNA is a methodology for studying the connections and behavior of individuals within social groups.
- [Friends don't lie: inferring personality traits from social network structure](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2370216.2370266)
  + Explanation: This article investigates the relationships between social network structure and personality; it assesses the performances of different subsets of structural network features, and in particular those concerned with ego-networks, in predicting the Big-5 personality traits. In addition to traditional survey-based data, this work focuses on social networks derived from real-life data gathered through smartphones.
- [Systematical Approach for Detecting the Intention and Intensity of Feelings on Social Network](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7421935)
  + Explanation: In this paper, a Feeling Distinguisher system is built based on supervised Latent Dirichlet Allocation (sLDA), Latent Dirichlet Allocation, and SentiWordNet methodologies for detecting a person's intention and intensity of feelings through the analysis of his/her online posts.
- [Adaptive Personality Recogntion from Text](http://eprints-phd.biblio.unitn.it/828/)
  + Explanation: This paper addresses the issue of domain adaptation for automatic Personality Recognition from Text (PRT). The PRT task consists in the classification of the personality traits of some authors, given some pieces of text they wrote.



## AI methods for Predicting Personality in Social Network

- [Deep learning-based personality recognition from text posts of online social networks](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10489-018-1212-4)
  + Explanation: This paper proposes a deep learning-based approach for personality recognition from text posts of online social network users.
- [Personality Prediction of Social Network Users Using Ensemble and XGBoost](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-981-15-2414-1_14)
  + Explanation: This work focuses on the effective detection of the personality of social network users, using advanced classifiers such as XGBoost and Ensemble for prediction.
- [Latent Personality Traits Assessment From Social Network Activity Using Contextual Language Embedding](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9531972)
  + Explantion: This study examines the potency of emerging natural language processing (NLP) methods in analyzing social network activity. A linguostylistic personality traits assessment (LPTA) system is developed to estimate Twitter users’ personality traits based on their tweets using the Myers-Briggs-type indicator (MBTI) and big-five personality scales.
- [Analysis of the Relationship between the Users Personality Traits and the Images They Post on Social Media](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877050921020561)
  + Explanation: In this study, a clustering model for digital traces of users is proposed based on VGG16 deep learning model and a K-means clustering algorithm. It uses this model for predictive analytics of digital footprints in the form of arbitrary images.
- [Social profiling through image understanding: Personality inference using convolutional neural networks](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1077314216301679)
  + Explanation: In this paper, a new level of image understanding with the ultimate goal of relating a set of image preferences to personality traits by using a deep learning framework is explored.


## Sentiment Analysis on Twitter

- [Artificial Intelligence Model for the Identification of the Personality of Twitter Users through the Analysis of Their Behavior in the Social Network](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9292/11/22/3811)
  + Explanation: In this work, the development of a data analysis model with machine learning algorithms with the ability to predict the personality of a user based on their activity on Twitter is proposed. To do this, a data collection and transformation process is carried out to be analyzed with sentiment analysis techniques and the linguistic analysis of tweets
