## People's Personalities and Feelings in Social Network





## AI methods for Predicting Personality in Social Network


- [Personality Traits Recognition on Social Network - Facebook](https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/ICWSM/article/view/14464)
  + This paper presents automatic recognition of Big-5 personality traits on social network (Facebook) using users’ status text.

- [Deep learning-based personality recognition from text posts of online social networks](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10489-018-1212-4)
  + This paper proposes a deep learning-based approach for personality recognition from text posts of online social network users.
- [Latent Personality Traits Assessment From Social Network Activity Using Contextual Language Embedding](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9531972)
  + Explantion: This study examines the potency of emerging natural language processing (NLP) methods in analyzing social network activity. A linguostylistic personality traits assessment (LPTA) system is developed to estimate Twitter users’ personality traits based on their tweets using the Myers-Briggs-type indicator (MBTI) and big-five personality scales.
- [Social profiling through image understanding: Personality inference using convolutional neural networks](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1077314216301679)
  + In this paper, a new level of image understanding with the ultimate goal of relating a set of image preferences to personality traits by using a deep learning framework is explored.

- [Recent trends in deep learning based personality detection](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10462-019-09770-z)
  + In this paper, we review significant machine learning models which have been employed for personality detection, with an emphasis on deep learning-based methods. 



## Sentiment Analysis and Personality Prediction on Twitter

- [Artificial Intelligence Model for the Identification of the Personality of Twitter Users through the Analysis of Their Behavior in the Social Network](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9292/11/22/3811)
  + In this work, the development of a data analysis model with machine learning algorithms with the ability to predict the personality of a user based on their activity on Twitter is proposed. To do this, a data collection and transformation process is carried out to be analyzed with sentiment analysis techniques and the linguistic analysis of tweets
- [Predicting Personality from Twitter](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/6113107)
  + In this paper, a method is presented by which a user's personality can be accurately predicted through the publicly available information on their Twitter profile.
- [Mining User Personality in Twitter](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Fabio-Celli/publication/268433988_Mining_User_Personality_in_Twitter/links/551933a90cf273292e70d840/Mining-User-Personality-in-Twitter.pdf)
  + The paper describes how we collected and annotated “Personalitwit”, a corpus of 25700 posts from the popular micro-blogging site Twitter, automatically annotated by user personality and by language with two computational linguistic tools. From the analysis of that data emerged how different writng styles and personality models are associated to different communitites using different devices to post to Twitter.
- [You are what you tweet: Personality expression and perception on Twitter](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S009265661200133X)
  + In this study, we measured the Big Five personality traits of 142 participants and collected their tweets over a 1-month period. Extraversion, agreeableness, openness, and neuroticism were associated with specific linguistic markers, suggesting that personality manifests in microblogs. 



## Sentiment Analysis and Personality Prediction on Persian Language and Twitter

- [MBTI Personality Prediction Approach on Persian Twitter](https://www.winlp.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/28_Paper.pdf)
  + In this paper, since there is no substantial study on Persian speakers’ personality detection, an efficient and high performance personality detection system in the Persian language is presented.
- [Adaptation of Sentiment Analysis Techniques to Persian Language](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-77116-8_10)
  + Sentiment analysis research has been growing rapidly; however, most of the research papers are focused on English. In this paper, we review English-based sentiment analysis approaches and discuss what adaption these approaches require to become applicable to the Persian language.
- [A transformer-based deep learning model for Persian moral sentiment analysis](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/01655515231188344)
  + We developed a Twitter data set of 8000 tweets that are manually annotated for moral foundations and also we established a baseline for computing moral sentiment from Persian text. We evaluate a plethora of state-of-the-art machine learning models, both rule-based and neural, including distributed dictionary representation (DDR), long short-term memory (LSTM) and bidirectional encoder representations from transformer (BERT) to address the issue of Moral Foundation theory (MFT).
  

## Facial Expression and Computer Vision studies on Twitter
- [Our Twitter Profiles, Our Selves: Predicting Personality with Twitter](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/6113111)
  + Since there has not been a study between personality and use of Twitter at large, we set out to analyze the relationship between personality and different types of Twitter users, including popular users and influentials. For 335 users, we gather personality data, analyze it, and find that both popular users and influentials are extroverts and emotionally stable (low in the trait of Neuroticism).
- [Personality analysis of the USA public using Twitter profile pictures](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8320184)
  + We have collected the Twitter profile data, last month tweets and stored them in MySQL data base. This collection of data sets is further analyzed with their profile images using features of color, image composition, image type, and their online behavior. We are predicting about their personality traits using their posts and online engagement on Twitter.
- [Cross-platform and cross-interaction study of user personality based on images on Twitter and Flickr](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0198660)
  + In this study, we analyzed variation in image content with user personality across three interaction types (posts, likes and profile images) and two platforms, using a unique data set of users who are active on both Twitter and Flickr.
