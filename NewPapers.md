  + This article proposes a novel system for detecting compromises of a social network account by considering both post behavior and textual content. A deep multi-layer perceptron-based autoencoder is leveraged to consolidate diverse features and extract underlying relationships.

- [Travel Behavior Classification: An Approach with Social Network and Deep Learning](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0361198118772723)
  + This study first examines the dataset of California Household Travel Survey (CHTS) between the years 2012 and 2013. After preprocessing and exploring the raw data, an activity matrix is constructed for each participant. The Jaccard similarity coefficient is employed to calculate matrix similarities between each pair of individuals. Moreover, given matrix similarity measures, a community social network is constructed for all participants.

- [A Fast Recognition Algorithm of Online Social Network Images Based on Deep Learning](https://web.p.ebscohost.com/abstract?direct=true&profile=ehost&scope=site&authtype=crawler&jrnl=07650019&AN=141469465&h=zjCtzHiUvxX2NAELCmkIMcUDU2vwv%2fwTjcHqAUJS%2fiSYpNi7YKJxdQWYQE%2ffl7HXbrQmkpDzcG5Mx8pqUB%2bPNw%3d%3d&crl=c&resultNs=AdminWebAuth&resultLocal=ErrCrlNotAuth&crlhashurl=login.aspx%3fdirect%3dtrue%26profile%3dehost%26scope%3dsite%26authtype%3dcrawler%26jrnl%3d07650019%26AN%3d141469465)
