## Sentiment Analysis and Personality Prediction on Persian Language and Twitter

- [Mapping the political landscape of Persian Twitter: The case of 2013 presidential election](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/2053951719835232)
  + This paper aims to present such cartography of the political landscape of Persian Twitter by studying the case of Iran's 2013 presidential election. The objective of this study is twofold: first, to fill the empirical gap in our knowledge about Twitter use in Iran, and second, to develop computational methods for studying Persian Twitter (e.g., effective methods for analyzing Persian text) and identify the best methods for addressing different issues (e.g., topic detection and sentiment analysis).
 
- [A predictive model based on machine learning methods to recognize fake Persian news on twitter](https://journals.semnan.ac.ir/article_4563.html)
  + The present study has attempted to use machine learning algorithms including SVM, k-NN, decision tree, random forest and MLP, to identify and classify fake and real news in the data set collected from Persian Twitter messenger.

  + In this paper, we provide a data-driven analysis of the Persian Twittersphere from a political perspective to demonstrate how the balance of power in the battle of ideas and ideologies has evolved over time, both in numeric terms and qualitatively.

- [Early Discovery of Emerging Entities in Persian Twitter with Semantic Similarity](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10139028)
  + This paper proposes EEPT that is an online clustering method able to discover EEs without any need for training on a dataset. Additionally, due to the lack of a proper evaluation metric, this paper uses a new metric to evaluate the results.


- [Twitter sentiment analysis from Iran about COVID 19 vaccine](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1871402121003878)
  + First, a total of 803278 Persian tweets were retrieved from Twitter, mentioning COVIran Barekat (the homegrown vaccine), Pfizer/BioNTech, AstraZeneca/Oxford, Moderna, and Sinopharm (imported vaccines) between April 1, 2021 and September 30, 2021. Then, we identified sentiments of retrieved tweets using a deep learning sentiment analysis model based on CNN-LSTM architecture. Finally, we investigated Iranian views toward COVID-19-vaccination.

- [Belief Mining in Persian Texts Based on Deep Learning and Users' Opinions (revised December 2022)](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10158496)
  +  In this method, first, the data is preprocessed with a deep neural network and then classified into political, cultural, economic, and sports classes, and the sentimental polarity is obtained. SentiPers is applied on four different datasets from Persian Twitter, Digikala store, Google translator, and synonym for evaluation.
 

- [Persian Emoji Prediction Using Deep Learning and Emoji Embedding](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9303639)
