## People's Personalities and Feelings in Social Network


## AI methods and Social Network

- [Social network analysis using deep learning: applications and schemes](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13278-021-00799-z)
  + In this paper, we provide an overview of state-of-the-art research for different applications of social network analysis using deep learning techniques. We consider applications such as opinion analysis, sentiment analysis, text classification, recommender systems, structural analysis, anomaly detection, and fake news detection.
 
- [Age Groups Classification in Social Network Using Deep Learning](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7932459)
  + This research suggests that one of the most relevant parameter contained in the user profile is the age group, showing that there are typical behaviors among users of the same age group, specifically, when these users write about the same topic. A detailed analysis with 7000 sentences was performed to determine which characteristics are relevant, such as, the use of punctuation, number of characters, media sharing, topics, among others; and which ones can be disregarded for the age groups classification
 
- [Online Social Network Security: A Comparative Review Using Machine Learning and Deep Learning](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11063-020-10416-3)
  + This paper comprehensively surveys the evolution of the online social networks, their associated risks and solutions. The various security models and the state of the art algorithms have been discussed along with a comparative meta-analysis using machine learning, deep learning, and statistical testing to recommend a better solution.
 
- [Using deep learning and social network analysis to understand and manage extreme flooding](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/1468-5973.12311)
  + This paper uses a subset of machine learning, deep learning (DL), to classify text content of 11,982 tweets, and we integrate that with SNA to understand the structure of tweet interactions. Our DL approach pre-trains our model with a DL language technique, BERT, and then trains the model using the standard training dataset to sort a dataset of tweets into classes tailored to crisis events.

- [Early Depression Detection from Social Network Using Deep Learning Techniques](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9231008)
  + In this research work, a hybrid model has been proposed that can detect depression by analyzing user's textual posts. Deep learning algorithms were trained using the training data and then performance has been evaluated on the test data of the dataset of reddit which was published for the pilot piece of work, Early Detection of Depression in CLEF eRisk 2017.
 
- [Identifying patterns of epistemic emotions with respect to interactions in massive online open courses using deep learning and social network analysis] (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0747563221001667)
  + By gathering multiple data generated by 1190 Chinese learners, this study employed a combination method of deep learning and social network analysis (SNA) to identify patterns of epistemic emotions with respect to interactions on a MOOC platform.
 
- [Detecting Compromised Social Network Accounts Using Deep Learning for Behavior and Text Analyses] (https://www.igi-global.com/article/detecting-compromised-social-network-accounts-using-deep-learning-for-behavior-and-text-analyses/274340)
  + This article proposes a novel system for detecting compromises of a social network account by considering both post behavior and textual content. A deep multi-layer perceptron-based autoencoder is leveraged to consolidate diverse features and extract underlying relationships.
