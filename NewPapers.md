  + In this work, the development of a data analysis model with machine learning algorithms with the ability to predict the personality of a user based on their activity on Twitter is proposed. To do this, a data collection and transformation process is carried out to be analyzed with sentiment analysis techniques and the linguistic analysis of tweets


## Sentiment Analysis and Personality Prediction on Persian Language and Twitter

- [MBTI Personality Prediction Approach on Persian Twitter](https://www.winlp.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/28_Paper.pdf)

## Facial Expression and Computer Vision studies on Twitter
- [Our Twitter Profiles, Our Selves: Predicting Personality with Twitter](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/6113111)
  + Since there has not been a study between personality and use of Twitter at large, we set out to analyze the relationship between personality and different types of Twitter users, including popular users and influentials. For 335 users, we gather personality data, analyze it, and find that both popular users and influentials are extroverts and emotionally stable (low in the trait of Neuroticism).
